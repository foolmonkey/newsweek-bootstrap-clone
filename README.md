# newsweek-bootstrap-clone
A clone of Newsweek using Bootstrap.

----

In this project, I recreated Newsweek using Bootstrap, alongside my own custom CSS rules. The website adapts to a variety of viewports, from desktop to mobile phones. 

Using Bootstrap, what I found most useful was: its 12-column grid, the ability to easily adapt to different viewports, and its reusable components (such as cards).
